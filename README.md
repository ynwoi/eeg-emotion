# Emotion Recognition Using EEG Signals
## I. Project Title
Emotion Recognition Using EEG Signals

## II. Project Introduction
In order to facilitate more effective interaction between computers and humans, it's essential for computers to recognize human emotions. Since the 1970s, there have been some universally acknowledged emotions that have been recognized using various biosignals. Among these, EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals have proven to be strong indicators for emotion classification. Moreover, multi-modal approaches have been used that combine GSR (Galvanic Skin Response), eye movements, EMG (Electromyography), etc. The aim of this project is to propose a deep learning model that functions effectively using a benchmark dataset.

## III. Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the SEED dataset, which uses EEG, EOG (Electrooculogram), EMG, GSR, RSP (Respiratory Signal), BP (Blood Pressure), and ST (Skin Temperature) to classify five different emotions. One of the crucial aspects of emotion datasets is to induce the emotion in the subject. This dataset uses 15 film clips, each lasting about 4 minutes, to evoke emotions. The dataset consists of data from 15 subjects. Each subject has contributed data in three separate sessions, with at least one week's gap between each session. The dataset from each session has been allocated into training, validation, and test sets.
